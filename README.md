<h1>Printing Shapes</h1>

<h1>Create a program that:</h1>

<ol>

 <li>Prompt the user to choose between a rectangle and a triangle</li>

 <li>Prompt user for shape parameters

  <ol>

   <li>Rectangle

    <ol>

     <li>Ask user to choose between supplying a word or a width</li>

     <li>Ask user for height</li>

    </ol></li>

   <li>Triangle

    <ol>

     <li>Ask user to choose between supplying a word or a width</li>

     <li>Ask whether the triangle points up or down</li>

    </ol></li>

   <li>Print the desired shape

    <ol>

     <li>Ask the user whether they want to print to a file, “myshape.txt”, or to cout

      <ol>

       <li>This can be accomplished using fewer lines of code by using the base ostream type as an argument, which ofstream and cout are both derived from. <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/ostream/ostream/">See here</a></li>

      </ol></li>

     <li>Ask the user if they would like to exit, or return to step 1</li>

    </ol></li>

  </ol></li>

</ol>

You must use at least two functions in this lab. How involved you get with them (including arguments, creating helper functions) is left up to you.

Points:

2 – Documentation, readability, format

2 – Proper program flow (conditionals, loops, etc)

1 – File output

<ul>

 <li>– Functions</li>

 <li>– Filename and Header2 – Output testing</li>

</ul>
